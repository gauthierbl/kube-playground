This is an example of [Persistent Volumes](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/) in Kubernetes.

The primary difference between this and the [Persistent Volumes Walkthrough](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/walkthrough/) is that this uses a deployment while the walkthrough uses raw pods.

To get started run `up.sh` and use `down.sh` to delete everything.
